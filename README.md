# csv2excel-zerosafe
This tool provides a reliable way to transform CSV files into Excel spreadsheets without losing important formatting details such as leading zeros in codes, IDs, or other numeric-like strings. Unlike many default converters that strip zeros (e.g., turning  into ), this project ensures your data integrity is fully maintained.
# How to use
You can use it as a function or you can paste your CSV data in the code and run it as an stand alone program and it will generate the excel file in the CWD(Current working directory) for you.
